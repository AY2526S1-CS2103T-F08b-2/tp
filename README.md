- This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  - as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  - as a case study
- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
---
This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
